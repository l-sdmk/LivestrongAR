								<h5 class="metroblacktwo">Dear Friends</h5>
								<p>Community. It’s the first word that comes to mind when I think about the LIVESTRONG Foundation. In 2012, I never felt more strongly about the power of community as we – together with you by our side – faced difficult headwinds and uncharted territory. </p>
								<p>Through that and beyond, as we move with, yes, excitement into a new, promising and singularly focused era for our Foundation, we have remained intently focused on what matters: people affected by cancer today and our mission to improve their lives. Last year, our 15th anniversary year, we achieved several significant successes that helped us perform at the highest level and positioned us to move forward with even greater success.</p>								
								<p id="read-more-doug" class="mobile"><a class="sentinelblackitalic black" style="text-decoration: underline;" href="#">Read More of Doug's Letter</a></p>
							</div>
				        </li>
				        <li class="slide-two">
							<div class="text-block block">
								<p>First, thanks to your hard work and support, we surpassed the 2.5-million-people-served milestone by helping a record number of people in 2012 through our free, one-on-one cancer support services. Offered in person, by phone and online, these highly personalized, deeply engaged services connect people to treatment options, financial counseling, clinical trial access, fertility preservation, insurance and transportation assistance, emotional support and much more. With 14 million Americans living with cancer now and 4,500 Americans receiving new diagnoses each day, we know the need is great. Most important, we know it works.  Research shows that addressing the concerns of the whole patient, alongside their medical treatment, produces measurably better outcomes in improved quality of life and prolonged survival.</p>
								<p>Second, in 2012, we worked on the front lines and across the globe to advance cancer care. We engaged in public policy matters that affect people with cancer and fought against the cancer stigmas that still exist – hampering life-saving diagnoses and treatment – in many parts of the world. Third, we continued our groundbreaking work to foster ongoing dialogue with cancer patients and survivors, through Foundation research and surveys, and gained deeper insights that inform both our programs and the wider cancer community’s treatment protocols.</p>
							</div>
				        </li>
						<li class="slide-three">
							<div class="text-block block">
								<p>Fourth, we worked closely with our many programmatic and cause marketing partners to strengthen our financial future, innovate expansions of our efforts and deliver first-rate services for those in need.</p>
								<p>Our accomplishments would not be possible without the steadfast commitment of our Chairman Jeff Garvey, our Board of Directors and our millions of dedicated supporters. Our success has always been derived from people from all walks of life that meet a cancer diagnosis with hope and more than a little grit. We are inspired by you to dream bigger and reach further.</p>
								<p>Although some things have changed, one thing remains absolutely true: this Foundation doesn’t back down from a challenge. Make no mistake that we will forge ahead boldly in 2013 to continue making a difference in the lives of people affected by cancer.</p>

								<p>Sarah and her husband were ready. Ready to start a family, ready to get back to normal life beyond cancer. Then, the second diagnosis came in. Breast cancer. Again. The news was devastating and the options were few.</p>
								<p>At 31, Sarah chose to have her ovaries removed, her best chance to survive. She thought it meant her dream of being a parent was over. She was fighting for her own life now. But when her oncologist mentioned the possibility of in vitro fertilization and connected Sarah to the LIVESTRONG Foundation, everything changed.</p>
								<p>Sarah and her husband worked with one of our navigators to help pay for the medications and services for freezing embryos. And when her sister-in-law stepped forward to be a surrogate, their dreams came true. Lilly Dee was born nine months later.</p>
								<p>Sarah sums it up, "The LIVESTRONG Foundation made what we thought was impossible... possible."</p>
