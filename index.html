								<h5 class="metroblacktwo">Dear Friends</h5>
								<p>Community. It’s the first word that comes to mind when I think about the LIVESTRONG Foundation. In 2012, I never felt more strongly about the power of community as we – together with you by our side – faced difficult headwinds and uncharted territory. </p>
								<p>Through that and beyond, as we move with, yes, excitement into a new, promising and singularly focused era for our Foundation, we have remained intently focused on what matters: people affected by cancer today and our mission to improve their lives. Last year, our 15th anniversary year, we achieved several significant successes that helped us perform at the highest level and positioned us to move forward with even greater success.</p>								
								<p id="read-more-doug" class="mobile"><a class="sentinelblackitalic black" style="text-decoration: underline;" href="#">Read More of Doug's Letter</a></p>
							</div>
				        </li>
				        <li class="slide-two">
							<div class="text-block block">
								<p>First, thanks to your hard work and support, we surpassed the 2.5-million-people-served milestone by helping a record number of people in 2012 through our free, one-on-one cancer support services. Offered in person, by phone and online, these highly personalized, deeply engaged services connect people to treatment options, financial counseling, clinical trial access, fertility preservation, insurance and transportation assistance, emotional support and much more. With 14 million Americans living with cancer now and 4,500 Americans receiving new diagnoses each day, we know the need is great. Most important, we know it works.  Research shows that addressing the concerns of the whole patient, alongside their medical treatment, produces measurably better outcomes in improved quality of life and prolonged survival.</p>
								<p>Second, in 2012, we worked on the front lines and across the globe to advance cancer care. We engaged in public policy matters that affect people with cancer and fought against the cancer stigmas that still exist – hampering life-saving diagnoses and treatment – in many parts of the world. Third, we continued our groundbreaking work to foster ongoing dialogue with cancer patients and survivors, through Foundation research and surveys, and gained deeper insights that inform both our programs and the wider cancer community’s treatment protocols.</p>
							</div>
				        </li>
						<li class="slide-three">
							<div class="text-block block">
								<p>Fourth, we worked closely with our many programmatic and cause marketing partners to strengthen our financial future, innovate expansions of our efforts and deliver first-rate services for those in need.</p>
								<p>Our accomplishments would not be possible without the steadfast commitment of our Chairman Jeff Garvey, our Board of Directors and our millions of dedicated supporters. Our success has always been derived from people from all walks of life that meet a cancer diagnosis with hope and more than a little grit. We are inspired by you to dream bigger and reach further.</p>
								<p>Although some things have changed, one thing remains absolutely true: this Foundation doesn’t back down from a challenge. Make no mistake that we will forge ahead boldly in 2013 to continue making a difference in the lives of people affected by cancer.</p>

								<p>Sarah and her husband were ready. Ready to start a family, ready to get back to normal life beyond cancer. Then, the second diagnosis came in. Breast cancer. Again. The news was devastating and the options were few.</p>
								<p>At 31, Sarah chose to have her ovaries removed, her best chance to survive. She thought it meant her dream of being a parent was over. She was fighting for her own life now. But when her oncologist mentioned the
									possibility of in vitro fertilization and connected Sarah to the LIVESTRONG Foundation, everything changed.</p>
								<p>Sarah and her husband worked with one of our navigators to help pay for the medications and services for freezing embryos. And when her sister-in-law stepped forward to be a surrogate, their dreams came true. Lilly Dee was born nine months later.</p>
								<p>Sarah sums it up, "The LIVESTRONG Foundation made what we thought was impossible... possible."</p>

								<p>A baseball coach, a husband, a friend, but more than anything, a man on a mission to spread the word about cancer education and awareness. When Brian was diagnosed with Stage 4 Melanoma, he found help through the LIVESTRONG Foundation, and we found a hero. Working with our navigation services, Brian received support with insurance, fertility and especially clinical trials. In turn, Brian became an outspoken advocate for not only the Foundation’s work, but for all those affected by cancer, championing his “Fight Like Hell” mantra.</p>

								<h1 class="metroblacktwo caps">The Impact of One<br />Man Running</h1>
								<p>The numbers are impressive, but the most impressive number from 2012 might have come in the form of miles. Steve Cannon loves to run like nobody else you know. So much so, he decided to take on 40 marathons in 40 days, but not just for any reason. For us. To raise money for those battling cancer today.</p>
								<p>When Steve began his 1000+ mile journey around Lake Michigan, he had no idea just how personally he would be affected during the process. On day 20, his mother called him to deliver the news that Steve’s Uncle Mike had stomach cancer. She passed along Uncle Mike’s words of encouragement and Steve continued. But only seven days later, Steve’s uncle passed away. His instinct was to stop and go home to be with his family, but his mother said, “Absolutely not! Uncle Mike runs with you now. You finish this.”</p>
								<p>Steve describes the rest of the 40-day event as a “journey within a journey.”</p>
								<p>“Uncle Mike ran the rest of that day and many others with me. I ran much of the day on his legs, knowing he was free from pain and with me, smiling every step.”</p>
								<p>On July 5, 2012, after becoming the first person to run around Lake Michigan, Steve returned to family and friends having raised $33,000 to help people affected by cancer today through the LIVESTRONG Foundation. He also returned with even more passion and drive to continue the fight. In 2013, he has organized the Million Dollar Marathon, where a team of over 100 runners will run across the country, coast to coast for cancer.</p>

								<p>Sam and his wife, Sandy, love playing golf together. The fresh air, the exercise, the views. Sam is especially good at chipping from just off the green. But when Sam found out that a swollen lymph gland was cancerous, he didn’t realize just how quickly the treatment would bring his life, and Sandy’s, to a halt.</p> 
								<p>After the radiation, Sam found himself losing weight, coordination, balance, and energy. Sandy knew he needed something to start him back on the road to recovery. When she saw in the local paper that the LIVESTRONG Foundation was working with cancer survivors at the YMCA, she knew it could change their life.</p>
								<p>Sam described the experience beautifully, “I could achieve things much more with a personal trainer who understands the effect of chemo and radiation than I was ever going to do on my own… You don’t have to tough it out on your own. There’s a program there to help you regain your confidence… your zest for life, and to know that there is quality life ahead of you.” And based on what Sam and Sandy have been up to, some quality rounds of golf, too.</p>
								<p>Sam is just one of the many people we’ve helped through impactful programs in local communities. With our continued growing partnerships and Community Impact Project (CIP), we have been able to expand our reach and help raise already successful programs to the next level.</p>

								<p>Stephanie Myers found out she had cancer in the 8th grade. She felt isolated. She felt alone at school. And when she lost her hair from chemo, she was laughed at.</p>
								<p>Andy Miller of the Foundation notes, “Cancer affects a large percentage of the American population. It affects their hopes, their dreams, their relationships. But no one ever teaches you about that.”</p>
								<p>Enter the LIVESTRONG at School program to help students cope with and learn about cancer and understand the impact it has on individuals, like Stephanie. We impacted more than 184,000 students and teachers in 2012. With one in three people in the U.S. facing a cancer diagnosis in their lifetime, children in classrooms everywhere are likely to be dealing with cancer right now. The LIVESTRONG at School curriculum offers online lessons for grades K–12 to help students learn about cancer in a way that is age-appropriate, inspiring and empowering.</p>

								<p>To this day, Clara Guzman still posts to her daughter’s Facebook page to share information about cancer. It’s part of a mission that her daughter, Karen, started by being one of the bravest teenagers you’d ever meet. When Karen found out she had cancer, she chose to fight. And share. And speak. And teach. And inspire. And she did it in Mexico, where the stigma of cancer causes many people to do just the opposite.</p>
								<p>Karen was one of the first public storytellers of Comparte tu Historia, a program launched by the LIVESTRONG Foundation in 2011. Though Karen lost her fight with cancer in 2012, she still battles the stigma of cancer in Mexico today. Her mother has started a foundation in Karen’s memory that educates teenagers against the stigma and misperceptions of cancer and encourages them to spread the word, so the silence of cancer can be overcome.</p>
								<p>This is why we do it. Not only in Mexico, but in South Africa and now beyond. Global knowledge of the disease is one of the biggest battles we face in treatment today.</p>
